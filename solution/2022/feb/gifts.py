in the graph, if there is a loop, all cows in the loop could get better gifts.
For example 1->5->6->1: Gift 1 is exchanged to Cow 5; Gift 5 is exchanged to Cow 6; Gift 6 is exchanged to Cow 1.
It works because initially Cow i has Gift i!
Use bfs search to find whether i could reach j. bfs is preferred in Python to avoid recursive calls.
Be aware that if i can reach j and j can reach i, does not necessarily mean there is a loop among i and j.
Example: loop1: 1->2->3->1; loop2: 4->2->3->4. loop 1 and loop 2 share a common edge 2->3.
         1 can reach 4 through 1->2->3->4; 4 can reach 1 through 4->2->3>4.
         But there is no simple loop among 1,4. 1->2->3->4->2->3->1. edge 2->3 passes twice!
For this question, it is not a problem, as it only needs to check direct link.

The question asks for the best POSSIBLE gifts for each cow, not best gifts for ALL cows.
Take the example above loop1: 1->2->3->1; loop2: 4->2->3->4. loop 1 and loop 2 share a common edge 2->3.
For Cow 1, she can take gift 3; For Cow 4, she can take gift 3 too;
But gift 3 canâ€™t be given to both Cow 1 and 4!
